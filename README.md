# Housing_in_Mexico_Project
In this project I have a dataset of 21000 properties for sale in Mexico through a real estate website. My goal is to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by size or location. Also I will use the project as an opportunity to explore various techniques of analyzing, cleaning, modeling and visualizing data with python.
